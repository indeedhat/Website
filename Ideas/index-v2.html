        <p>Hello, I'm Dominic and I like to do web development in my spare time. I created by first website
          when I was 19, I was amazed how easy it was to understand the basics which gives me the
          confidence to keep going. I enjoy playing games with my friends whilst streaming on
          youtube. I also taught myself how to play an electric guitar and I played in a concert at
          the Tall Ships and Sunderland Empire. In july 2019 I completed a the Duke Of Edinburgh
          Gold Award, it was very challenging and hard work.
        </p>

        <p>I have just finished level 2 BTEC I.T at Gatehead College and I would like to show you some of my
          college work.
